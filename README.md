Game inspired by hangman

In the classic children's game of Hangman, a player's objective is to identify a hidden word of which only the number of letters is originally revealed. In each round, the player guesses a letter of the alphabet: if it's present in the word, all instances are revealed; otherwise one of the hangman's body parts is drawn in on a gibbet. The game ends in a win if the word is entirely revealed by correct guesses, and ends in loss if the hangman's body is completely revealed instead. To assist the player, a visible record of all guessed letters is typically maintained.

My game is to guess a computer generated word. The player, just like in the hangman, has 15 attempts to guess, if he correctly enters all the letters - he wins, otherwise he loses the game and the word is shown on the screen. When a player re-enters a letter or an incorrect character, a warning message will be displayed.
